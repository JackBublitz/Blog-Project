                    My name is Jack! I study Communication Design at Victoria University of Wellington. This website was
                    created to showcase my work completed as apart of Victoria's Web Design course. Code is something I
                    find very challenging, this course has had a large learning curve for me. Despite this, I believe
                    there is value for me, as prospective graphic designer, in learning at least the fundementals of
                    HTML and CSS. This would allow me to communicate better with developers and understand what can and
                    can't be done. This knowledge will also allow me to make better use of visual coding tools like
                    webflow, a tool I will no doubt encounter in my career.
