                This first task was intended for us to showcase our knowledge of HTML and CSS, seeing as I was entering
                the class with no knowledge of either, other than there basic premise, I didn’t really come up with
                anything remotely resembling any website. However after some time spent coding and some of the
                miscellaneous tutorials, I revisited this task. I wanted to recreate the nav from Bandcamp, a relatively
                simple nav. A nav is something found on the majority of websites that are more complex than one or two
                pages so learning how to structure and style one could prove extremely beneficial. It uses CSS grids and
                includes everything from an interactive search bar with place holder text as well as buttons with hover
                states accurate to the official site. This was a good challenge and was the most complex thing I have
                made in HTML/CSS up until this point. My classmate Jamie Gambles assisted with some of the more complex
                elements providing a more detailed breakdown and tutorial on how they work. This task has given me a lot
                more confidence in HTML with familiarisation with grids being the biggest gain as formatting was
                something I struggled with in my previous experiences with html.

                One of the major downsides to using grids is its support, grids is still a relatively new addition to
                the HTML and CSS ecosystem, and before grids, flex boxes would have been the way to go. Flex boxes are
                useful in for making your website format shift and change depending on the size of your viewport when
                used in conjunction with media queries. This could help in the creation of my blog and project 3 where
                we are required to create flexible website that works on both mobile and desktop.

                This was Figma based project that didn’t include any coding. Instead we had to wireframe a website for
                one of two briefs, I opted for the Vic brief in which I had to wireframe a replacement for the current
                vic course selection site. I look at the biggest contentions I have with Vic services and attempted to
                rectify them in my design. My biggest sticking points with the current system is the lack of
                unification, there a re a million different sites and pages you are thrown between, and the fact that
                the actual selection process is seperate from the info, you can’t see the description or availability of
                certain courses when selecting you have to do it all first on paper and then go through and make you
                selection. My wireframes strive to create a more coherent experience, allowing you to pick and drop
                course as you go, with the course information available at the time of selection.

                For project 3 we have to develop a website as apart of group. My group has opted to create a
                showcase/index of ‘ethical’ businesses. This is a simple concept however we intend to make the finished
                site quite complex with a single page of html and a viewport that moves to certain areas on the page
                using java script. Above are our initial wireframes.

                This was the most daunting project as it was an independent development project, we had to code the blog
                by ourselves. This was an ongoing project and never had it’s own time, therefore I opted to focus on the
                basics, ensuring it scaled well on a mobile device, using media queries to rearrange my layout in
                circumstances where required. I focused on creating a unique and coherent visual style and adding
                general quality of life feature like a jump to top button at the bottom of the scroll.
